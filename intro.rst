Computer Architecture
---------------------

Key tools:
    - Pipelining: overlap steps in execution, dependency-aware
    - Parallelism
    - out-of-order execution
    - prediction: EAFP
    - caching
    - indirection: go through translation step to allow intervention
    - amortization: coarse-grain actions to amortize start/end overheads
    - redundancy
    - specialization: trim overhead of genpurpose
    - focus on the common case: optimize the fundamentals
