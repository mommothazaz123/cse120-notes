Instruction Set Architecture
============================
Chapter 2

an ISA is the hardware/software interface
- agreement between programmer (compiler constructor) and hardware
- defines the visible state of the system (registers, memory)
- defines how instructions change processor state
- defines the instructions and encodings

it does not define:
- how instructions are implemented
- how fast/slow instructions are
- how much powers instructions consume
